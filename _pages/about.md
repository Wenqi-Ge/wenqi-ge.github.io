I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at HKUST's [Aerial Robotics Group](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk/), under the guidance of Prof. [Shaojie Shen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=u8Q0_xsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree from the [IRMV Lab](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was mentored by Prof. [Hesheng Wang](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng).

My primary research interests encompass robotics and autonomous driving, with a particular emphasis on robust estimation, global localization, and long-term mapping.

If you have any good ideas or cooperation intentions, please feel free to contact me at zqiaoac@connect.ust.hk :)
