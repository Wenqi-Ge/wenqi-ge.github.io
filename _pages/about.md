I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. at SusTech's [RcvLab](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk/), under the guidance of Prof. [Hong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=u8Q0_xsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Prior to this, I earned my B's degree from the [HeFei University of Technology](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My primary research interests encompass robotics and scene understanding, with a particular emphasis on scene understanding, scementic mapping, and final step of robot task.

If you have any good ideas or cooperation intentions, please feel free to contact me at winkyge99@gmail.com :)
